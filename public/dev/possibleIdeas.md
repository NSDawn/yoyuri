# Possible Ideas

## Lookup 

- screen on interface to look up 
    - wiki style
    - pulling (raw html) or smth? or wiki md?

## case files

- in order to solve the case, you need to fill out a few questions, you need to keep 'slamming your head against a wall' in order to solve
- gameplay: story scenes -> free time (finish case) => story scenes
- multiple ways of solve -> no specific path

## Stats

- Charisma
    - NPCs kinder to you?
    - make more money per interaction
- Knowledge
    - More things to look up
- Perception
    - Can check easier?

## case 1

A Two-Door in Tijuana
- Colin Williamson and his girlfriend Sylvia Cain are in Tijuana from San Diego (?)
- Colin, drunk, crashes their car at 21:00.
- S, knowing that A is a criminal, steals A's car. However, A is able to regain control


Who stole the car? 

Who owns the car? 

What was its cargo?
